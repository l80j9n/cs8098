Background section (200 words)   
   
Four days school system refers to students attending classes four days a week instead of the traditional five. It means that school schedule eliminates one day per week from the school calendar and extends the length of other      four school days. The four-day system is usually found in rural areas and some urban areas. It is a concept that has been used in rural areas for decades to cope with budget shortfalls(Turner,2019). After the the COVID-19 pandemic, teacher burnout and shortages have plagued the education system (Morton,2024).In order to save potential costs, more and more schools are adopting a shortened school week, from five days to four days. It has implications for schools, teachers, and students. The four-day school week can bring a series of benefits, but it also has a series of negative effects. It can help to increase student engagement, reduce substance use behaviors, reduce non-school screen time and increase physical activity,but it also increased bullying, increased sexual activity, decreased sleep, and breakfast consumption(   Israel, et al.2020).   
The purpose of this research is to investigate the pros and cons of four-day school system and whether it can be ref代 写Should the school week be shortened to four days?

Reading List[Text Wrapping Break](sources read, but not   cited)   
   
Genre:    
You have a clear working title. In the aim, give the reason(s) for suggesting this topic. Are students in the 5-day school week really tired?    There are a lot of sources about this.    
You can also add to the questions such as which day would be chosen for closing? Would Wednesday be the best choice to rest in the middle of the week? See what your sources suggest and if you agree. Some would suggest Friday to have a longer weekend.    
Be more precise in the rationale. Are there issues about the current system? Can the change be sufficiently positive to make a change worthwhile? Evaluate the reasons. Some schools currently have 4.5 days and want to lower the time spent in school to set aside time for other activities. Is this justified?   
You will have to give reasons for your own opinion which is to maintain the 5-day week.      
Criticality    
You need more sources and list them using the Harvard style. with the year of publication just after the author’s names. You found rather recent sources, which is good.    
What is the scope for your background? Does it refer to the USA, GB or other countries. Give precise laws about it. Some schools work on Wednesday mornings and Saturday mornings, meaning 6 days a week for students to get up early, yet that only comes to 5 days. You should   refer to that option as well as having school only in the mornings. Try to widen the topic. You should also mention if the debate concerns all types of schools including private and independent ones or just state-funded public schools.      
Language   
Your written English is clear with only a few errors, such as in subject and verb agreement (the system needs).      
Next steps   
Go over the feedback and make the scope more specific. You can bring out the differences in several countries if you would rather not work on just one country, but it should be mentioned in your paper. You need to find more sources before you write Submission 2 and have from 10 to 12 sources for the final submission (using the Harvard Reference Style).
